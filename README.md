# Snake

A recreation of the classic [Snake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre)) video game displayed entirely in the terminal using Unicode characters and [ANSI escape codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code).

Run with 
```
python3 main.py
```

I made this game so that I could create a program that will play it using deep reinforcement learing. More on that soon.

* Works best on Ubuntu.
* Works okay on Mac.
* Probably doesn't work on Windows.
